### DUPI Streaming AWS Flow Log Monitor

Monitor and analyze AWS Flow Logs from EC2 network interfaces, VPC subnets or entire VPCs on a dedicated AWS cloud server streaming network traffic statistics in real-time to your browser via DUPI Streaming AWS Flow Log Monitor (**DUPI** = **D**eep-**U**niversal-**P**rotocol-**I**nspection).

An AWS lambda function exports all relevant flow data to a dedicated cloud server to enable observation of aggregate protocol statistics across multiple virtual sites to view network traffic in your business as a 'whole' or at individual sites.

Analyze your network traffic in real-time for deep visibility into actual traffic patterns. Define detailed alerting rules per specific protocol field on various metrics as request rates, bps, pps, lengths, counts and geo-location info.

Explore network traffic at your sites easily and interactively from the comfort of your browser. Quickly switch protocols, fields, intervals and apply specific filter conditions in the web application for instant streaming results.
